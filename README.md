## Tech Stack

- MySQL

## Data Source:

This project was one of the 8 projects to be done in my Data Analytics Internship. Data Source was provided by the company.

## Project Goals

- Enhance Operational Efficiency: Identify areas for improvement within the company's operations by analyzing key metrics and user behavior.
- Investigate Metric Spikes & Dips: Utilize advanced SQL techniques to pinpoint the root causes of sudden changes in critical metrics, such as user engagement, sales figures, or support ticket volume.
- Actionable Insights for Departments: Collaborate with departments like operations, support, and marketing to translate data insights into actionable strategies that drive business growth.

## Part 1: Job Data Analysis

### Dataset Information

The dataset for the first part of the project involves a table named job_data with the following columns:

- job_id: Unique identifier of jobs
- actor_id: Unique identifier of actor
- event: The type of event (decision/skip/transfer).
- language: The Language of the content
- time_spent: Time spent to review the job in seconds.
- org: The Organization of the actor
- ds: The date in the format yyyy/mm/dd (stored as text).

### Data Analysis

- Jobs Reviewed Over Time: Analyzed how many jobs were reviewed each hour for every day in November 2020. This helps understand workload distribution.
- Throughput Analysis: Calculated the 7-day rolling average of events per second to identify trends over a weekly period, useful for strategic planning. Daily metrics provide real-time insights for operational decisions.
- Language Share Analysis: Identified the percentage share of each programming language used in the past 30 days. This helps understand which languages are most common in the data.
- Duplicate Rows Detection: This query identifies rows in the job_data table that are considered duplicates based on specific columns.

## Part 2: Investigating Metric Spike

### Dataset Information

The dataset involved in the Part 2 of the analysis contains three tables:

- users: Contains one row per user, with descriptive information about that userâ€™s account.
- events: Contains one row per event, where an event is an action that a user has taken (e.g., login, messaging, search).
- email_events: Contains events specific to the sending of emails.

### Data Analysis

- Weekly User Engagement: Tracked user activity on a weekly basis to understand user behavior and preferences.
- User Growth Analysis: Analyzed user acquisition and growth over time to aid strategic planning.
- Weekly Retention Analysis: Analyzed how many users stay active after signing up to identify areas for improvement in user retention.
- Weekly Engagement Per Device: Measured user activity on a weekly basis for each device to optimize user experiences on specific devices.
- Email Engagement Analysis: Analyzed user engagement with email campaigns by calculating metrics like open rates, click-through rates, and success percentages.

## Benefits:

Improved operational efficiency through data-driven decision-making.
Enhanced understanding of user behavior and preferences.
Faster identification and resolution of issues impacting key metrics.

This project demonstrates expertise in using SQL for operational analytics and investigating metric spikes, a valuable skillset for any organization seeking to optimize business processes and make data-driven decisions.
