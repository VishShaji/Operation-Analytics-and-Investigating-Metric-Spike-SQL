## Part 1: Job Data Analysis

- Jobs Reviewed Over Time: Analyzed how many jobs were reviewed each hour for every day in November 2020. This helps understand workload distribution.
- Throughput Analysis: Calculated the 7-day rolling average of events per second to identify trends over a weekly period, useful for strategic planning. Daily metrics provide real-time insights for operational decisions.
- Language Share Analysis: Identified the percentage share of each programming language used in the past 30 days. This helps understand which languages are most common in the data.
- Duplicate Rows Detection: This query identifies rows in the job_data table that are considered duplicates based on specific columns.

## Part 1: Investigating Metric Spike

- Weekly User Engagement: Tracked user activity on a weekly basis to understand user behavior and preferences.
- User Growth Analysis: Analyzed user acquisition and growth over time to aid strategic planning.
- Weekly Retention Analysis: Analyzed how many users stay active after signing up to identify areas for improvement in user retention.
- Weekly Engagement Per Device: Measured user activity on a weekly basis for each device to optimize user experiences on specific devices.
- Email Engagement Analysis: Analyzed user engagement with email campaigns by calculating metrics like open rates, click-through rates, and success percentages.

## Benefits:

Improved operational efficiency through data-driven decision-making.
Enhanced understanding of user behavior and preferences.
Faster identification and resolution of issues impacting key metrics.

This project demonstrates expertise in using SQL for operational analytics and investigating metric spikes, a valuable skillset for any organization seeking to optimize business processes and make data-driven decisions.
